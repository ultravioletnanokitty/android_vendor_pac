android_vendor_pac
==================

ultraviolet's fork of the PAC-man 4.1 vendor repository

goals of this fork:

- add support for currently vacant devices that only have 4.1
- add bootlogo overlays for missing vendors
- optimise and update everything
- maybe a full-on PAC4.1 fork in the future?
